### ✨ Projects I'm working on
- **My commissions website [Cosmo's Commissions](https://cosmoscommissions.gay).**
   - This website serves as my main landing page for people looking to commission me, and allows customers and promoters to log in and check their invoices via Discord.
   - The website also has Admin pages that allow me to track invoices, add entries to my showcase page, and manage promoters.
   - I am utilizing Supabase and Vercel to run the database and host the website, respectively.
   - Most of the codebase was created utilizing Curser, as I am still learning JS, TS, and HTML.
   - **Current Issues**
     - My function that creates a new entry into my profiles table upon a new user logging in is failing to populate a new row.
       - Users who are already in the system can log in.
       - New users are sent into an endless login loop
- **Power injector for USB-C devices**
  - I am designing a USB-C power injector to address an issue with Quest Link, where many computers cannot supply enough continuous power to keep the headset charged during use.
  - The injector allows a high-power external charger to power the headset while maintaining high-speed data transfer with the computer and preventing power from being back-fed into the PC.
  - This, in turn, reduces the load on the computer by removing sustained high current draw from the PC’s USB-C port.

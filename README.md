### ✨ Projects I'm working on
- My commissions website [Cosmo's Commissions](https://cosmoscommissions.gay).
   - This website serves as my main landing page for people looking to commission me, and allows customers and promoters to log in and check their invoices via Discord.
   - The website also has Admin pages that allow me to track invoices, add entries to my showcase page, and manage promoters.
   - I am utilizing Supabase and Vercel to run the database and host the website, respectively.
   - Most of the codebase was created utilizing Curser, as I am still learning JS, TS, and HTML.
   - **Current Issues**
     - My function that creates a new entry into my profiles table upon a new user logging in is failing to populate a new row.
       - Users who are already in the system can log in.
       - New users are sent into an endless login loop
- Learn how to use AWS
  - I am currently learning how to use AWS.

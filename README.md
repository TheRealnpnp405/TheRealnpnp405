### ✨ Projects I'm working on
- My commissions website [Cosmo's Commissions](https://cosmoscommissions.gay).
   - This website serves as my main landing page for people looking to commission me, and allows customors and premotors to login and check their invoices via Discord.
   - The website also has Admin pages that allow me to track invoices, add entries to my showcase page, and manage premotors.
   - I am utilzing Supabase and Vercel to run the database and host the website respectivly.
   - Most of the codebase was created utalizing Curser, as I am still learning JS, TS, and HTML.
   - **Current Issues**
     - My function that creates a new entry into my profiles table uppon a new user logging in, is faling to populate a new row.
       - Useres that are already in the system are able to login.
       - New users are sent into an endless login loop
- Learn how to use AWS
  - I am currently learning how to use AWS.
